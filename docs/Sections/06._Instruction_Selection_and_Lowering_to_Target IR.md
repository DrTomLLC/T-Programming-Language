# 06. Instruction Selection & Lowering to Target IR

**Overview**

Instruction selection translates the target‐independent Low‐level Intermediate Representation (LIR) into a target‐specific Intermediate Representation (TIR) or directly into target machine instructions. This section specifies pattern matching, DAG generation, lowering rules, legalizations, and peephole optimizations.

---

## 6.1 Goals & Responsibilities

* **Correctness**: Ensure semantic equivalence between LIR operations and generated target instructions.
* **Performance**: Choose efficient instruction sequences, leveraging addressing modes and specialized opcodes.
* **Composability**: Permit multilayered lowering (e.g., LIR → TIR → MachineInst).
* **Extensibility**: Allow backends to plug in custom patterns, legalization policies, and post‐selection optimizations.

## 6.2 Core Data Structures

```rust
/// A pattern node in the selection DAG.
enum PatNode {
    Op(OpCode, Vec<PatNodeRef>), // operation with operand subpatterns
    Imm(i64),                     // immediate constant
    Reg(Reg),                     // virtual register operand
}

/// A rule mapping a pattern to a sequence of target nodes.
struct SelectionRule {
    pattern: PatNode,             // tree pattern to match
    cost: u32,                    // heuristic cost
    actions: Vec<LowerAction>,    // rewriting actions
}

/// A lowering action: emit TIR nodes or MachineInsts.
enum LowerAction {
    EmitInst(MachineOpcode, Vec<Operand>),
    Split(i32, Vec<LowerAction>), // split into parts for legality
}

/// Context carrying LIR function and target info.
struct LowerCtx<'a> {
    lir_fn: &'a LirFunction,
    tir_fn: &'a mut TirFunction,
    rules: &'a [SelectionRule],
    target_isa: &'a TargetIsa,
}
```

## 6.3 Lowering Pipeline

1. **Pre‐selection Legalization**: Rewrite unsupported LIR ops into legal subtrees (e.g., 128‐bit addition → two 64‐bit ops).
2. **DAG Construction**: Represent basic block operations as a Directed Acyclic Graph of `PatNode`s, capturing data dependencies.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Traverse DAG, apply lowest‐cost `SelectionRule`s to cover all nodes.
4. **Rule Application**: For each match, invoke `LowerAction`s to emit TIR nodes or `MachineInst`s.
5. **Peephole Optimization**: Scan emergent TIR or instruction sequences to fuse or simplify adjacent instructions (e.g., merge load+op)
6. **Register Hinting**: Annotate TIR with register preferences to guide allocation phase.
7. **Finalize**: Produce a fully lowered `MachineInstSequence` per basic block.

---

## 6.4 Legalization & Customization

* **LegalizationPolicy** trait to define lowerings for unsupported opcodes or custom types.
* **Target‐specific RuleSets**: Each backend supplies its own `SelectionRule` table, loaded at registration.
* **Dynamic Pattern Addition**: Plugins can register extra patterns at runtime (e.g., vectorization rules).

---

## 6.5 Testing & Validation

* **Pattern Coverage Tests**: Ensure every LIR opcode maps to at least one rule or legalization.
* **DAG‐based Fuzzing**: Random DAGs lowered and verified against interpreter semantics.
* **Golden Tests**: Compare TIR or machine output for known input functions across targets.
* **Benchmarks**: Evaluate instruction quality (count, latency) on microbenchmarks.

# SectionÂ 14: Runtime & Standard Library

## 14.1 Runtime Architecture

* Interpreter vs JIT vs AOT models
* Execution engine components: scheduler, code loader, GC, stack frames
* Bootstrapping sequence, startup initialization, embedding APIs

## 14.2 Memory Management

* Heap allocator design: bump, pool, and general-purpose allocators
* Garbage collection strategies: tracing, reference counting, region-based
* Manual memory APIs, unsafe pointers, ownership transfer

## 14.3 Concurrency & Asynchronous Runtime

* Threading model: OS threads, green/lightweight threads, fibers
* Async runtime: event loop, reactor patterns, futures, async/await
* Synchronization primitives: mutexes, condition variables, atomics, channels
* Task scheduling, work-stealing, cooperative vs preemptive multitasking

## 14.4 Foreign Function Interface & Interoperability

* C ABI compatibility: data layout, calling conventions, marshalling
* Dynamic plugin loading with libloading: safety, versioning, symbol lookup
* Embedding T runtime in host applications and scripting host interfaces

## 14.5 Core Standard Library Modules

* **Collections**: Vec, Array, HashMap, BTreeMap, Stack, Queue
* **IO**: File, TCP/UDP Socket, Stream abstractions, buffered IO
* **Networking**: HTTP client/server, WebSocket, async networking primitives
* **Concurrency Utilities**: Thread pool, async channels, sync primitives
* **Utilities**: Strings, formatting, date/time, randomness, serialization
* **OS & Process**: Filesystem, environment variables, subprocess management

## 14.6 Error Handling & Diagnostics at Runtime

* Panic vs abort strategies, configurable unwind behavior
* Structured error types, propagation, and backtrace capture
* Logging APIs with levels, formatting, backends (console, file, remote)
* Integration with telemetry and metrics frameworks

## 14.7 Tooling & Packaging

* Runtime versioning and compatibility guarantees
* Packaging formats: single static executable, shared library, Docker/container images
* CLI tools for inspection, REPL, debugger hooks, debugger integration (GDB, LLDB)

## 14.8 Profiling, Monitoring & Instrumentation

* Built-in profiling hooks: CPU/memory sampling, flamegraph support
* Custom instrumentation: metrics, events, tracing spans
* Integration with external tools: perf, eBPF, OpenTelemetry

## 14.9 Security & Sandbox

* Capability-based security model, sandboxed execution environments
* Memory safety checks, bounds checking, ASLR/DEP mitigations
* Cryptographic modules: TLS support, secure random, hashing

## 14.10 Future Extensions

* Pluggable and real-time garbage collectors
* On-stack replacement, hot code reloading, live patching
* Distributed runtime: cluster execution, remote actor frameworks
* WebAssembly integration: embedding Wasm VM and Runtime APIs

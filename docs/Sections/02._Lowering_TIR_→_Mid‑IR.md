# 02. Lowering TIR → Mid‑IR

> Deep dive into the design, algorithms, and extension points for lowering from TIR to the SSA‑style Mid‑IR.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Define the transformation contract from TIR (Typed Intermediate Representation) to an initial, SSA‑style Mid‑IR.
* Establish clear invariants that the Mid‑IR must satisfy for downstream analyses and optimizations.
* Document extension hooks for custom language features or plugin‑provided lowering.

## 2. Scope

* All transformations applied in this stage:

    1. Desugaring high‑level constructs (pattern match, `for`‑loops, algebraic data types)
    2. Control‑flow graph construction
    3. Preliminary name resolution of temporaries
    4. Emission of stubbed basic blocks and phi nodes

## 3. Inputs & Outputs

### 3.1 Input: TIR

* **Representation:** Tree of expressions, statements, item definitions with full type annotations.
* **Key Data Structures:**

    * `TirModule { items: Vec<TirItem> }`
    * `TirExpr` / `TirStmt` enums capturing constructs like `Let`, `Match`, `Loop`, `Call`, etc.

### 3.2 Output: Mid‑IR Stub

* **Representation:** Flat list of `MirBlock`s, each with a sequence of `MirInstr` and an explicit terminator.
* **Key Data Structures:**

    * `MirGraph { entry: BlockId, blocks: HashMap<BlockId, MirBlock> }`
    * `MirInstr` variants for `Assign`, `Jump`, `CondJump`, `Phi` (with placeholder operand slots).

## 4. Transformation Steps

### 4.1 Desugaring

* **Pattern Matching:**

    * Expand `match` into nested `if` chains or jump tables.
    * Lower variant constructors into integer discriminants + payload.

* **Algebraic Data Types & Enums:**

    * Assign each enum variant a tag; represent payload as tuple of fields.

* **`for` Loops & Comprehensions:**

    * Lower into explicit iterator protocol: obtain iterator, loop with `next()`, break on `None`.

### 4.2 Control‑Flow Graph (CFG) Construction

* **Basic Block Identification:**

    * Start a new block at function entry, after labels, and at each control‑flow instruction.

* **Block Linking:**

    * For each `if`, `loop`, `match` branch, emit a `CondJump` or `Jump` terminator referring to target block IDs.

### 4.3 SSA Stub Generation

* **Temporary Variables:**

    * For each expression producing a value, allocate a fresh `mir_temp` ID.
    * Insert `Assign(temp, operand)` instructions.

* **Phi Nodes:**

    * Insert placeholder `Phi` at block starts for each variable that merges across multiple predecessors.
    * Leave operand slots empty until CFG is finalized.

### 4.4 Invariants & Validation

* **Well‑Formedness Checks:**

    * Every `Jump` target must exist.
    * No unreachable blocks (to be pruned later).
    * All `mir_temp` IDs are defined before use.

## 5. Extension Points

* **Plugin Hook: `LowerTirPlugin`**

  ```rust
  pub trait LowerTirPlugin {
      /// Invoked per TIR function before standard lowering.
      fn pre_lower(&self, func: &TirFunction);

      /// Allows injecting or rewriting MirGraph nodes.
      fn rewrite_mir(&self, mir: &mut MirGraph);

      /// Invoked per function after lowering, before validation.
      fn post_lower(&self, mir: &MirGraph);
  }
  ```

* **Configuration Flags:**

    * `--tir-lower-inline-threshold` to control when small functions are inlined at TIR level.
    * `--tir-remove-unused` to prune dead-binding at this stage.

## 6. Testing & Validation

* **Unit Tests:**

    * Golden tests: input TIR snippets → expected MirGraph dumps.
    * Property tests: random AST → round‑trip serialization invariants.

* **Performance Benchmarks:**

    * Measure lowering time on large modules (\~10k LOC).
    * Track memory usage and peak temporary count.

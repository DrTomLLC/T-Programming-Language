# Section 10: Standard Library & Runtime

## 10.1 Overview

Describe the core standard library components and runtime support provided by T‑Lang, including memory management, I/O, concurrency, error handling, and platform abstractions.

## 10.2 Core Modules

* **Prelude**: Essential traits, types, and functions automatically imported.
* **Collections**: Vectors, maps, sets, queues, linked lists, etc.
* **String & Text**: Immutable strings, mutable buffers, formatting, I/O.
* **Math & Numerics**: Numeric traits, operations, constants, arbitrary precision.
* **Time & Date**: Clocks, timers, durations, time zones.
* **Filesystem & I/O**: File, path, network I/O abstractions, streams.
* **Process & OS**: Environment variables, subprocess spawning, signals.

## 10.3 Memory & Resource Management

* Ownership and smart pointers in the standard library (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `RefCell`, etc.).
* **Garbage Collection** (optional features) vs **Manual** management.
* **Drop** traits for deterministic resource cleanup.

## 10.4 Concurrency & Parallelism

* Threads: spawning, joining, and synchronization primitives (mutexes, channels).
* Async runtime: futures, executors, `async`/`await` support.
* Task scheduling strategies and work-stealing.

## 10.5 Error Handling & Diagnostics

* Standard error and panic handling patterns.
* Diagnostic structures: backtraces, logging integration, categorized error types.

## 10.6 Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

* Interoperability with C, Zig, and other languages.
* Safety guidelines, `unsafe` blocks, and boundary checks.

## 10.7 Platform Abstractions

* Conditional compilation for target-specific code (`#[cfg]`).
* Abstraction layers for Windows, Unix, embedded platforms.

## 10.8 Runtime Initialization & Shutdown

* Global state initialization, plugin init hooks, logging setup.
* Graceful shutdown sequences and cleanup routines.

## 10.9 Testing, Benchmarking & Profiling

* Built‑in test harness, test attributes, integration tests.
* Benchmarking tools and conventions.
* Profiling hooks and instrumentation support.

## 10.10 Future Directions

* Expanding async support, green threads, real‑time scheduling.
* Memory safety enhancements: region-based or borrow-checker improvements.
* Embedded‑specific runtime features: no‑std support, minimal allocators.

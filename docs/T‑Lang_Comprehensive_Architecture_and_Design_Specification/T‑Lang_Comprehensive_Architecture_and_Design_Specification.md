#### 22.2.2 Energy & Power Hints

* **Internal representation:** discrete levels 0–31, mapping each named level to specific hardware P-states.

* **Example mapping:**

    * Ultra Efficient → internal level 4 → CPU min freq, aggressive sleep states
    * High Efficient → internal level 8 → conservative governors, reduced cache pressure
    * Moderate Efficient → internal level 12 → balanced with efficiency bias
    * Balanced → internal level 16 → default balanced profile
    * Moderate Performance → internal level 20 → performance bias, higher frequencies
    * High Performance → internal level 24 → aggressive prefetch, higher voltages
    * Ultra Performance → internal level 28 → maximum frequencies, all optimizations

* `#[tlang(power_scale = <0..31>)]` — set fine‑grained internal power/performance level.

* `#[tlang(governor = "dvfs")]` — use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling driver.

### 22.6 Scripting & Inline Code

### 22.8 Debugging & Profiling

* `#pragma tlang(debug_statements(enable|disable, scope = "line"|"block"|"file"|"project"))` — automatically insert or strip DEBUG logging statements across specified scopes without altering code semantics.

* `#pragma tlang(breakpoint)` — insert compiler‑emitted breakpoint.

* `#[tlang(profile(cpu_cycles|cache_misses|branch_mispredicts))]` — hardware performance counter hooks.

* `#pragma tlang(measure(time|memory))` — emit timing and memory usage reports.### 22.9 Conditional Compilation & Features

* `#[cfg(feature = "embedded")]`, `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]` etc.

* `#[cfg_attr(feature = "simd", tlang(vectorize))]` — combine flags.

### 22.10 Meta‑Programming & Custom Pragmas

* Users can define custom pragmas via plugin API:

  ```rust
  // in a plugin:
  registry.register_pragma("my_directive", |args, context| { /* handler code */ });
  ```
* `#pragma tlang(invoke = "my_directive(arg1, arg2)")` — call custom handler.

### 22.11 Bit‑Level Control

* `#pragma tlang(bit_flip(mask = 0xFF, bits = [0,3,7]))` — flip specified bits in a value.
* `#[tlang(bit_mask = "0b101010")]` — apply bitmask to constant or variable.

* `#[tlang(freq_bounds(min_hz = 300e6, max_hz = 3.5e9))]` — fine‑grained DVFS bounds.
* `#pragma tlang(power_hint(thread = "affinity", level = "low_latency" | "energy_efficient"))` — per‑thread scheduling and power hints.
* `#pragma tlang(thermal_throttle(enable|disable))` — dynamic thermal management.

### 22.13 Seamless Integration

* Directives can be combined and nested; conflicts resolved by priority order: line > block > item > module > global.
* `#[tlang(priority = <number>)]` — override directive precedence.
* All pragmas and attributes interoperate across embedded, scripting, and FFI contexts without requiring external build files.

*With these directives, T‑Lang code can be tweaked per-line, per-block, or per-item to satisfy any optimization, safety, profiling, domain‑specific or bit‑level requirement—without hacks or external build scripts.*

# Semantic Analysis & Type System

Semantic Analysis is the compiler phase that takes an AST and checks it for meaning beyond mere syntax. It ensures that the program is valid with respect to the language’s semantic rules (name binding, typing, scoping), and annotates the AST with type information for subsequent phases (codegen, optimization).

---

## 1. Goals

* **Correctness**: Detect and report semantic errors early (undefined names, type mismatches, scope violations).
* **Type Safety**: Enforce the language’s type rules strictly or via configurable modes (strict vs. permissive).
* **Performance**: Scale to large codebases with incremental or on‑demand analysis.
* **Extensibility**: Provide hooks for user‑defined types, plugin‑supplied type rules, and macro expansions.

## 2. Major Components

### 2.1 Symbol Table & Scoping

* **Global & Local Scopes**: Hierarchical symbol tables for modules, functions, blocks.
* **Name Resolution**: Bind identifiers to declarations; support shadowing, imports, and reopening modules.
* **Overloading & Traits**: Lookup based on name and signature, with trait‑based resolution.

### 2.2 Type System

* **Primitive Types**: Integer, floating‑point, boolean, character, string.
* **Composite Types**: Tuples, arrays, structs, unions, enums.
* **Reference Types**: Pointers, references, borrowing rules (if applicable).
* **Function Types**: Parameter and return types, variadic, generics.
* **Generic & Parametric Types**: Parameterized structs, functions, traits/services.

### 2.3 Type Inference & Checking

* **Local Inference**: Deduce types of variables & expressions when not annotated.
* **Constraint Solving**: Collect and solve constraints for generics and overloaded operators.
* **Unification Engine**: Merge type variables and detect mismatches.
* **Coercion & Casting**: Built‑in conversion rules and user‑defined cast operators.

### 2.4 Semantic Validation

* **Control Flow Checks**: Exhaustive `match`, unreachable code warnings, definite initialization.
* **Resource Safety**: Lifetime checks, drop/destructor rules.
* **Effect Systems** (future): Track side‑effects, purity annotations.

## 3. Error Reporting & Recovery

* **Precise Diagnostics**: Report location, explanation, and suggestions.
* **Error Recovery**: Continue analysis beyond errors using best‑effort bindings.
* **Suppression & Levels**: Allow warnings vs. errors via compiler flags.

---

## 4. Extension Points

* **Plugin API Hooks**:

    * Custom symbol binders
    * Additional type rules (e.g., external DSL types)
    * Linting & style checks
* **Macro System Integration**:

    * Hygiene, expansion phases
    * Type‑aware macro transforms

---

## 5. Future Work

* **Module Systems**: Namespaces, friend modules, cyclic imports.
* **Dependent Types & Refinements**: Optional advanced type features.
* **Incremental & Parallel Analysis**: Watch mode, distributed builds.

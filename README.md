# 🅣 T Programming Language

**T** is a small, fast, safe, and future-proof programming language designed to solve as many problems as possible — without the bloat, chaos, or dependency hell of traditional ecosystems.

## ✨ Goals

- 🚀 As fast or faster than Rust
- 💡 As readable as Python
- 🧠 As intelligent as Clippy, built-in (via Tippy)
- 🔒 Safety-first, even in unsafe blocks
- ⚙️ Built-in scripting, compiling, GUI, web, DB, interop, and more
- 📦 Zero dependency hell (via Targo + Tup)
- 🧪 Secure by default, formally verifiable, memory safe
- 🔌 Fully interoperable with Rust, Zig, Roc, V, C/C++, Python, Go, JS, etc.
